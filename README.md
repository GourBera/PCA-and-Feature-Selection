# PCA Dimensionality Reduction


Projection of new direction based on maximaum variance inorder to minimize the information loss

Transfor data points from higher dimention to transformed value

variance [willingness or flexibility of an Algorithm to learn] for PCA is spread of the data distribution
Small variance indicates- data points are kind of closly clustered
Large variance indicates- data points are spreaded

Determination of PCA- the direction that has the largest variance
